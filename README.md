Data Structures implemented

LinkedList

BinaryTree

Queue

HashTable

A roster of 20 students is created. Either through reading a text file or adding one a time. If the roster is full(20) then the extra students are added to a waiting list. When the program is finished it saves the final roster alphabetized by last name as well as a waiting list and a hashtable to see the mapping of the students to some key values.
